# Amazon-Clone
My attempt towards developing a full stack clone of the Amazon App using React.js, with the site being deployed using FireBase and using FireStore as the database.

Implemented complete payment functionality using Stripe.js and handled authentication using Google Authentication.

[Check out the site over here](https://clone-2dafa.web.app/) (Might be down for some updates)
